// We can use comparisons to check if a number is less than or greater than another number.
// To check if a number is less than another number, we use the less-than operator, <.

// If the number on the left is less than the number on the right, like in 1 < 235, the result is true.

// If the number on the left isn't less than the number on the right, like in 235 < 1, the result is false.

// To check if a number is greater than another number, we use the greater-than operator, >.
console.log(5 > 3); // true

// To check if a number is less than or equal to another number, we use the less-than-or-equal-to operator, <=.
console.log(3 <= 5); // true

// If the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right, like in 11 <= 11, the result is true.
console.log(11 <= 11); // true

// To check if a number is greater than or equal to another number, we use the greater-than-or-equal-to operator, >=.

// To store the result of a comparison in a variable, we use the = sign. This is the assignment operator.

// We can also use a comparison operator to compare a variable with another variable, like in min <= max.
